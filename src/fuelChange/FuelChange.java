Hello.
I am Mateusz Styczy≈Ñski and I have been learning Java for the past few weeks,
as I want to be an automation software tester in the future.
I used to be an engineer in the environment protection sector which is how I came across the idea for the following program.
It calculates coefficients regarding profitability of fuel source change in terms of thermal modernization.
All data was gathered while working as technical advisor in the renewable energy department.
